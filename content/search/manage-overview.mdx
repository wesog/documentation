Wesog Search provides a comprehensive API for managing your image assets with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This guide covers the essential concepts and best practices for effective asset management.

## Quick Start

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Upload images" icon="plus" href="/content/search/manage-upload">
    Upload new images to Wesog Search
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update images" icon="pen" href="/content/search/manage-update">
    Update existing image metadata
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete images" icon="minus" href="/content/search/manage-delete">
    Delete images from Wesog Search
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Operations Overview

All operations support both single image and **batch processing** for efficient management of large image collections.

| Operation              | Endpoint       | Required Fields | Optional Fields          | Purpose                    |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Upload new images      | `POST /imgs`   | `id`, `src`     | Image metadata fields    | Add images to the system   |
| Update existing images | `PUT /imgs`    | `id`            | Image metadata fields    | Modify existing metadata   |
| Delete existing images | `DELETE /imgs` | `id`            | None                     | Remove images from system  |

<Note>
Each image must have a **unique identifier** (`id`). The `src` field should contain the publicly accessible URL of the image.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts will help you choose the right configuration for your use case:

### Execution Modes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synchronous (Default)" icon="clock">
    **Best for**: Small operations (< 10 uploads, < 50 updates, < 100 deletes)
    
    **Behavior**: Waits for completion before sending response
  </Card>
  <Card title="Asynchronous" icon="background">
    **Best for**: Large batch operations
    
    **Behavior**: Returns immediately with operation ID for tracking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Processing Modes

| Mode | Behavior | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Strict** (default) | Fails if ID conflicts occur | Production environments, data integrity critical |
| **Relaxed** (not implemented) | Handles conflicts flexibly | Bulk imports, development |

<Tip>
Start with **Strict + Synchronous** for small operations, then switch to **Strict + Asynchronous** for larger batches.
</Tip>

### Error Handling

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **All or Nothing** (default) | Entire operation fails if any image fails | Critical operations requiring consistency |
| **Subset** (not implemented) | Processes valid images, reports failures | Large-scale imports, fault tolerance needed |

## Operation Monitoring

For asynchronous operations, you can track progress using the operations endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `GET /ops` | List all operations | Array of operation objects |
| `GET /ops/{operation_id}` | Get specific operation status | Single operation object with detailed status |

### Operation Status Indicators

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `finished=false`, `success=null` | **Processing** - Operation is still running |
| `finished=true`, `success=true` | **Completed** - All items processed successfully |
| `finished=true`, `success=false` | **Failed** - Operation aborted, check error details |

<Warning>
If an operation fails (`success=false`), no database changes are made. Check the error message and retry with corrected data.
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration

### Strict Mode Behavior

| Operation | Strict Mode Behavior | Impact |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Upload** | Error if `id` already exists | Prevents accidental overwrites |
| **Update** | Error if `id` doesn't exist | Ensures you're modifying existing data |
| **Delete** | Ignores missing `id` | Safe deletion of potentially removed items |

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Development" icon="code">
    - Use synchronous mode for testing
    - Start with small batches
    - Validate data structure first
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Production" icon="shield">
    - Use asynchronous for large operations
    - Monitor operation status
    - Implement retry logic for failures
  </Card>
