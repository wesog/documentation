Wesog Search supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for asset management.

| Operation              | Endpoint       | Required image fields | Optional image fields    |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Upload new images      | `POST /imgs`   | `id`, `src`           | Image metadata fields... |
| Update existing images | `PUT /imgs`    | `id`                  | Image metadata fields... |
| Delete existing images | `DELETE /imgs` | `id`                  | No                       |

Each operation can be executed with a single image or a **batch** of images, and there are different sections for each group of operations.

## Relaxed vs Strict Mode

Wesog Search requires that each image must have a **unique identifier** (`id`). When performing new operations, it is important to manage interactions with existing content, ensuring no duplicate ids.

In Relaxed mode, operations adapt flexibly by overwriting or creating records as needed, whereas Strict mode, the operation only is executed if it meets the rule for unique IDs.

| Operation              | Relaxed (not yet implemented)    | Strict (default)             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Upload new images      | Overwrite if `id` exists         | Error if `id` exists         |
| Update existing images | Create if `id` doesn't exist (*) | Error if `id` doesn't exist  |
| Delete existing images | Ignore if `id` doesn't exist     | Ignore if `id` doesn't exist |

> (*) Update existing images in Relaxed mode, only Create new images if `id` doesn't exist **and `src` is present**. Otherwise the image can not be created because the `src` is missing.

## Error Management

Handling errors such as undownloadable image URLs or duplicate image IDs (in strict mode) is crucial. Wesog Search supports two modes:

| All or nothing (`do=all`) (default) | Subset (`do=subset`) (not yet implemented) |
|----------------|--------|
| Operations are atomic; if one image fails, the entire operation fails. | Successfully processes valid images and returns error IDs and messages for failed ones. Useful for large-scale operations (e.g., initial ingestion). |


## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Synchronous (`mode=sync`) (default) | Asynchronous (`mode=async`) |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Waits** for the operation to complete before sending the response. | **Immediately returns** the response with an operation ID; continues the operation in the background. The operation id can be used later for tracking the upload process. |

Synchronous mode is recommended for small operations, while asynchronous mode is better for larger operations to avoid timeouts. Considered small operations include:
- Uploading fewer than 10 images
- Updating fewer than 50 images
- Deleting fewer than 100 images


### Asynchronous Operation Statuses

Endpoints for tracking operation statuses:

| Operation              | Endpoint                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Get all operations     | `GET /ops`                |
| Get a single operation | `GET /ops/{operation_id}` |

- `finished=False` and `success=null`: Operation is still processing (`num_processed` < `num_total`).
- `finished=True` and `success=True`: Operation completed successfully with database saving (`num_processed` = `num_total`).
- `finished=True` and `success=False`: Operation aborted with no database changes. Check the message field using the operation ID for error details and retry accordingly.
