## Semantic Text Search

Wesog Search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the complete context of each search, allowing users to find images using just words. Wesog Search analyzes the semantic context of the query and returns images that closely match the provided description, offering much more accurate and relevant results.

This capability is particularly valuable in editorial environments where manual tagging of large image volumes can be incomplete or inaccurate. Thanks to this semantic search technology, users can locate relevant content without relying on it being previously documented.

## Reverse Image Search
Users can upload a query image, and the system will return visually similar images - this similarity can be both semantic (retrieving related images) or identity-based (finding the exact image, or a modified version thereof).

Additionally, there is the option to filter the results based on the faces of characters identified within the image through Wesog Celebrity Recognition. This option also allows filtering the results by Keyword and dates.

## Multimodal Search
Wesog Search introduces an advanced functionality that combines **images and text** in a single query, providing users with the capability to perform complex searches with unparalleled flexibility.

This multimodal search capability is particularly useful for industries that manage complex visual media, such as digital marketing, publishing, and entertainment. It allows for more refined search results, ideal for conducting advanced visual campaigns.

## Order Results
In addition to performing semantic searches where images and text can be combined, it's possible to order results following different criteria, such as similarity, date, alphabetically, etc., so that this ordering will be applied to the search results obtained.

## Celebrity Recognition
The API offers an advanced facial recognition system, designed specifically to identify celebrities with high accuracy.

Our technology is capable of identifying faces with a minimum resolution of 30x30 pixels.

### Identification in Challenging Conditions
The system can recognize faces even if they are partially covered, such as with sunglasses, or if the person is in profile. This is crucial for obtaining reliable results in low-quality images or with limited visibility.

## Hybrid Search
Our revolutionary engine combines AI search technology with traditional database technologies. This allows leveraging the speed and accuracy of new search technologies with the robustness of classic database structures.

Hybrid search enhances efficiency and scalability in search operations, making it ideal for conducting advanced searches on large quantities of images, and sorting the results in various ways.

## Multilingual Search
Wesog Search currently supports seven languages, with the option to add more as needed by the customer. Ideal for providing relevant results to a diverse audience.

Un ejemplo de donde se puede ver el funcionamiento adecuado del sistema empleando por ejemplo alemán es el vídeo mostrado en el apartado Identification in Challenging Conditions, mientras que en los otros ejemplos se usa principalmente el inglés.
## Billions of Images
Wesog Search is designed to handle large volumes of data, processing billions of images without sacrificing speed or accuracy.

This **scalability** makes it perfect for massive archives or companies that need to manage vast amounts of visual content.

## Fast Content Update
Content management, such as uploading or deleting images, is incredibly fast. New data changes are instantly accessible, allowing users to always work with the most current information.

This is crucial in time-sensitive environments, such as media outlets or news archives.
