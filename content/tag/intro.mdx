Wesog Tag is the second main product of Wesog. It is an AI-based annotation tool to enrich your media content with minimal effort. This tool supports not only keyword generation but also caption creation, color extraction, and OCR processing on images sent to the serviceâ€”automating the extraction of valuable information without manual intervention and significantly reducing the costs associated with these workflows in the audiovisual industry.

## Examples
The following shows different examples of use cases for this tool.

### Celebrity Recognition
It's possible to quickly recognize celebrities in close-up images, not only extracting the faces found but also generating keywords and obtaining additional information about the identified people.

### Group Detection
Wesog Tag is also capable of detecting celebrities in groups with many people, where quality may be reduced, as can be seen in the following video.

### Language Customization
It's not only possible to retrieve information directly in English, but as shown in our following video, it's possible to adjust the language to display content in different languages, such as English or Japanese.

This video shows how the tagging task is performed in English.

This last video shows an example where captions, keywords, and other information are displayed directly in Japanese, making our technology ideal for working with different languages and cultures.
