Wesgo Search supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for asset management.

| Operation              | Endpoint       |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Upload new images      | `POST /imgs`   |
| Update existing images | `PUT /imgs`    |
| Delete existing images | `DELETE /imgs` |


## Relaxed vs Strict Mode

| Operation              | Relaxed (not yet implemented) | Strict (default)          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Upload new images      | Overwrite if exists           | Error if exists           |
| Update existing images | Create if doesn't exist       | Error if doesn't exist    |
| Delete existing images | Ignore if doesn't exist       | Ignore if doesn't exist   |


## Error Management

Handling errors such as undownloadable image URLs or duplicate image IDs (in strict mode) is crucial. Wesgo Search supports two modes:

| All_or_nothing | Subset (not yet implemented) |
|----------------|--------|
| Operations are atomic; if one image fails, the entire operation fails. | Successfully processes valid images and returns error IDs and messages for failed ones. Useful for large-scale operations (e.g., initial ingestion). |


## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Waits** for the operation to complete before sending the response. | **Immediately returns** the response with an operation ID; continues the operation in the background. The operation id can be used later for tracking the upload process. |

Synchronous mode is recommended for small operations, while asynchronous mode is better for larger operations to avoid timeouts. Considered small operations include:
- Uploading fewer than 10 images
- Updating fewer than 50 images
- Deleting fewer than 100 images


### Asynchronous Operation Statuses

Endpoints for tracking operation statuses:

| Operation              | Endpoint                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Get all operations     | `GET /ops`                |
| Get a single operation | `GET /ops/{operation_id}` |

- `finished=False` and `success=null`: Operation is still processing (`num_processed` < `num_total`).
- `finished=True` and `success=True`: Operation completed successfully with database saving (`num_processed` = `num_total`).
- `finished=True` and `success=False`: Operation aborted with no database changes. Check the message field using the operation ID for error details and retry accordingly.
