The `q` url parameter of the search endpoint (`GET /imgs`) defines the **query filtering formula (QFF)**. This parameter uses a special syntax that allows various filter combinations using Boolean operators and supports subfilters for more granular searches.

## Filter

Filters are the basic block of the QFF, they are defined by a filter prefix followed by a colon `:`, and then the filter value:

```
<prefix>:<value>
```

> #### Filter prefixes
> Wesog search supports several types of prefixes. The most common are `t:` for *textual filters*, `i:` for *reverse image search* and `p:` for *person (celebrity) search* 

**Examples:**

- Text filter `t:us elections` searches for images semantically similar to "us elections".
- Text filter `t:"us elections"` perfoms a fulltext searches for images containing "us elections" in their title, headline or caption.
- Keyword filter `k:us elections` searches for images tagged with the keyword "us elections".
- Date filter `d:1998` searches for photographies taken in 1998.
- Date filter `d:>2020-03-11` searches for photographies post pandemic.


## Filter with subfilters

Some filters (image `i:`, person `p:`, author `a:`) can have subfilters. Subfilter specifies further properties of a filter. Subfilters are defined after the the filter containg. the "subfilter query formula" between sqare brakets.

**Examples:**

- `p:taylor swift[a:20]` search for pictures of Talyor swift at the age of 20 years old.
- `p:taylor swift[t:green dress and cowboy boots]` search for pictures of Talyor swift with that clothes.
- `p:donald trump[k:smiling k:lookingToCamera]` search for pictures of Donald Trump smiling, looking to camera.
- `p:anyone[a:>80]` search for pictures of any celebrity with more than 80 years old.
- `a:anyone[g:woman & a:>70]` search for pictures done by women (women photographer or painters).
- `i:1234[t:at winter]`. Considering 1234 the id of a previusly upluaded photo of the stockholm skyline at summer. Ssearch for pictures of Stockholm at Winter

## Combining Filters with Boolean Operators

You can combine filters using the following Boolean operators:

- `&`: Logical **AND**
- `|`: Logical **OR**
- `!`: Logical **NOT**

Parentheses `()` can be used to group filters and control the order of operations.

**Examples:**

- `t:beach & c:blue` searches for images of beaches **and** the color blue.
- `t:beach | t:mountain` searches for images of beaches **or** mountains.
- `t:beach & !c:blue` searches for images of beaches **but not** the color blue.
- `t:beach & (!c:blue | c:yellow)` searches for images of beaches with the colors blue or yellow.
