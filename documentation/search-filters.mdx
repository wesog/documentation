The `q` url parameter of the search endpoint (`GET /imgs`) defines the **query filtering formula**. This parameter uses a special syntax that allows various filter combinations using boolean operators and supports subfilters for more granular searches.

## Filter Syntax

Filters are the basic block of the QFF, they are defined by a filter prefix followed by a colon `:`, and then the filter value:

```
<filter acronym><filter operator><filter value>
```

## Available Filters and Subfilters

List of avaliable filters and subfilters along with their prefixes:

**Examples:**

- Text filter `t~us elections` searches for images semantically similar to "us elections".
- Text filter `t=us elections` perfoms a fulltext searches for images containing "us elections" in their title, headline or caption.
- Keyword filter `k=us elections` searches for images tagged with the keyword "us elections".
- Date filter `d=1998-*-*` searches for photographies taken in 1998.
- Date filter `d>2020-03-11` searches for photographies post pandemic.


> #### Filter operators
> Wesog search supports several filters operators:
> - `~`: Similar. Used for AI semantic search (for text,image) and subwords search for the rest of filters.
>   - `~~`: "Very similar"
>   - `~~~`: "Super similar"
> - `=`: Equal.
>   - `==`: "Very equal"
>   - `===`: "Super equal"
> - Range comparison. For numeric filters, for dates, but also alphabetical order for single string filters.
>   - `<`: Less than.
>   - `>`: Greater than.
>   - `<=`: Greater or equal than. Aliases: `=<`, `≤`.
>   - `>=`: Less or equal than. Aliases: `=<`, `≥`.


## Filter with subfilters

<Warning>Subfilters are not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>

Some filters (image `i`, person `p`, author `a`) can have subfilters. Subfilter specifies further properties of a filter. Subfilters are defined after the the filter containg. the "subfilter query formula" between sqare brakets.

**Examples:**

- `p=taylor swift[a=20]` search for pictures of Talyor swift at the age of 20 years old.
- `p=taylor swift[t=green dress and cowboy boots]` search for pictures of Talyor swift with that clothes.
- `p=donald trump[k=smiling k=lookingToCamera]` search for pictures of Donald Trump smiling, looking to camera.
- `p=anyone[a>80]` search for pictures of any celebrity with more than 80 years old.
- `a=anyone[g=woman & a>70]` search for pictures done by women (women photographer or painters).
- `i=1234[t=at winter]`. Considering 1234 the id of a previusly upluaded photo of the stockholm skyline at summer. Ssearch for pictures of Stockholm at Winter

## Combining Filters with Boolean Operators

You can combine filters using the following Boolean operators:

- `&&`: Logical **AND**
- `||`: Logical **OR**
- `!`: Logical **NOT**

Parentheses `()` can be used to group filters and control the order of operations.

**Examples:**

- `t=beach && c=blue` searches for images of beaches **and** the color blue.
- `t=beach || t=mountain` searches for images of beaches **or** mountains.
- `t=beach && !c=blue` searches for images of beaches **but not** the color blue.
- `t=beach && (!c=blue || c=yellow)` searches for images of beaches with the colors blue or yellow.


## Examples


1. **Search for images of cats or dogs, excluding black and white images:**
```
(t=cats || t=dogs) && !m=bw_photo
```

2. **Search for images of Barack Obama aged between 40 and 50, taken in Washington D.C.:**

```

3. **Search for images of anonymous females aged 20-30, who are smiling or wearing glasses:**

```

4. **Search for images of Taylor Swift or Selena Gomez performing on stage, featuring the color red:**
```

```

5. **Search for images taken in Paris or London of buildings with Gothic architecture:**
```
(l=Paris || l=London) && k=gothic architecture
```

6. **Search for images similar to image REF 54321 with a "sunset" modification, excluding images with people:**
```

```

7. **Search for images of anonymous males aged 30-40, running or jumping, taken in New York City:**
```

```

8. **Search for 16:9 aspect ratio images of beaches at sunset, taken in 2020:**
```
r=16:9 && t=beach && t=sunset && d=2020-*-*
```

9. **Search for images with the keyword "nature," medium type "photograph" or "illustration," and aspect ratio 4:3:**
```
k=nature && (m=photograph || m=illustration) && r:4:3
```
