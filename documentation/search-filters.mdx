The `q` url parameter of the search endpoint (`GET /imgs`) defines the **query filtering formula**. This parameter uses a special syntax that allows various filter combinations using boolean operators and supports subfilters for more granular searches.

## Filter Syntax
Filters form the fundamental component of the query filtering formula. They adhere to the syntax outlined below:

```
<filter acronym><filter operator><filter value>
```

#### Filter acronym
Each filter can be identified by multiple acronyms. For example, the **keyword** filter can be referred to by the following acronyms: `k`, `key`, `keywords`.


#### Filter operator
Wesog search supports several filters operators:
- `~`: Similar. Used for AI semantic search (for text,image) and subwords search for the rest of filters.
  - `~~`: "Very similar"
  - `~~~`: "Super similar"
- `=`: Equal.
  - `==`: "Very equal"
  - `===`: "Super equal"
- Range comparison. For numeric filters, for dates, but also alphabetical order for single string filters.
  - `<`: Less than.
  - `>`: Greater than.
  - `<=`: Greater or equal than. Aliases: `=<`, `≤`.
  - `>=`: Less or equal than. Aliases: `=<`, `≥`.
- Set comparison. 
  - `=`: Must contain all of them.
  - `∩`: Must contain at least one of them. (Intersection).


#### Filter value
Each filter has a different format. Here are some examples:
- Date: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY`. Eg. `d=2005-5-13`
- Keyword: Comma separated. Eg. `k=blue, sky`
- City: Single string. Eg. `cit=Paris`

## Filter with subfilters

<Warning>Subfilters are not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>

Some filters (image `i`, person `p`, author `a`) can have subfilters. Subfilter specifies further properties of a filter. Subfilters are defined after the the filter containg. the "subfilter query formula" between sqare brakets.

**Examples:**

- `p=taylor swift[a=20]` search for pictures of Talyor swift at the age of 20 years old.
- `p=taylor swift[t=green dress and cowboy boots]` search for pictures of Talyor swift with that clothes.
- `p=donald trump[k=smiling k=lookingToCamera]` search for pictures of Donald Trump smiling, looking to camera.
- `p=anyone[a>80]` search for pictures of any celebrity with more than 80 years old.
- `a=anyone[g=woman && a>70]` search for pictures done by women (women photographer or painters).
- `i=1234[t=at winter]`. Considering 1234 the id of a previusly upluaded photo of the stockholm skyline at summer. Ssearch for pictures of Stockholm at Winter

## Combining Filters with Boolean Operators

You can combine filters using the following Boolean operators:

- `&&`: Logical **AND**
- `||`: Logical **OR**
- `!`: Logical **NOT**

Parentheses `()` can be used to group filters and control the order of operations.

**Examples:**

- `t=beach && c=blue` searches for images of beaches **and** the color blue.
- `t=beach || t=mountain` searches for images of beaches **or** mountains.
- `t=beach && !c=blue` searches for images of beaches **but not** the color blue.
- `t=beach && (!c=blue || c=yellow)` searches for images of beaches with the colors blue or yellow.

```
(l=Paris || l=London) && k=gothic architecture
```

6. **Search for images similar to image REF 54321 with a "sunset" modification, excluding images with people:**

```

7. **Search for images of anonymous males aged 30-40, running or jumping, taken in New York City:**
```
p=anyone[g=male && a≥30 && a≤40 && (t=running || t=jumping)] && l=New York City
```

8. **Search for 16:9 aspect ratio images of beaches at sunset, taken in 2020:**
```
r=16:9 && t=beach && t=sunset && d=2020-*-*
```

9. **Search for images with the keyword "nature," medium type "photograph" or "illustration," and aspect ratio 4:3:**
```
k=nature && (m=photograph || m=illustration) && r:4:3
```

10. **Search for images of people celebrating with more than 5 people, taken in 2019:**
```
t=celebrating && n>5 && d=2019-*-*
```
