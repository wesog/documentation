This is Reverse image search and, like text filters (`t`), can perform both AI and extact search, using one of the following operators:

- `~`: It performs semantic search. (AI search).
- `=`: It performs identity search. This will reatreve images that are an exact copy or a modified version like a cropping, fliping or any other type of modification.

Note that the query image can be:
- A new image uploaded by the user. In this case the image reference will be in the resoponse after uploading the image with the `/query_files` endpoint.
- An existing image. In this case, the image reference will be the original id of that photo provided by the client.


## Text subfilter `t`
<Warning>This subfilter is not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>

We can modify the semantic content of the image with a semantic text modification. This is useful when we want to modify the meaning / composition / style of the query image.


## Examples
Cosidering a 123456789 as the image reference:

- `i~123456789` AI search for finding similar images. 
- `i=123456789` Identity search for finding exact matches. 
- `i~123456789[t~at night]` AI search with text modification (eg. changing a day light picture to be at night)
