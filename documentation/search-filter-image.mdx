This is Reverse image search and, like text filters (`t:___`), also have 2 searching modes:

1. Image_ref without quotes: It performs semantic search. (AI search).
2. Image_ref between quotes: It performs identity search. This will reatreve images that are an exact copy or a modified version like a cropping, fliping or any other type of modification.

Note that the query image can be:
- A new image uploaded by the user. In this case the image reference will be in the resoponse after uploading the image with the `/query_files` endpoint.
- An existing image. In this case, the image reference will be the original id of that photo provided by the client.

## Image subfilter `i:___[t:___]`

Only for semantic search, we can modify the semantic content of the image with a semantic text modification. This is useful when we want to modify the meaning / composition / style of the query image. Examples

## Examples

Cosidering a 123456789 as the image reference:

- `i:123456789` AI search for finding similar images. 
- `i:"123456789"` Identity search for finding exact matches. 
- `i:123456789[t:at night]` AI search with text modification (eg. changing a day light picture to be at night)
