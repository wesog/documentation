An image can be used as a search query, this is called Reverse Image Search, and, like text filters (`t`), can perform both AI and identity search:

- `~`: It performs semantic search. (AI search).
- `=`: It performs identity search. This will reatreve images that are an exact copy or a modified version like a cropping, fliping or any other type of modification.


Sometimes too many results appear (false positives) and we would like to narrow the search. For those situautations wesog Search allows 3 levels of image filter operators for both semantic and identity search:


| Url Parameters               | Description                               | Example                                                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `i~ref with sort_by=sim`    | Broad semantic search. False positives may appears.   | any pet can appear at searching with "Golden Retriever" image         |
| `i~~ref with sort_by=sim`   | Narrow semantic search                    | any dog can appear at searching with "Golden Retriever" image         |
| `i~~~ref with sort_by=sim`  | Very Narrow semantic search               | only Golden Retriever (or even Labrador) at searching with "Golden Retriever" img |
| `i=ref with sort_by=sim`    | Identity search with all transformations (easy and hard ones). False positives may appears. | Severe zooms in/out, lot of overlays, Horizontal Flip, Rotation, ...  |
| `i==ref with sort_by=sim`   | Identity search with small transformations| Subtle cropping, recolor, black & white, ...                          |
| `i===ref with sort_by=sim`  | Identity search of same image only        | Very subtle transformations (JPEG compression, etc.)                  |


## Image Reference

In order to use a image in the search query we need its image reference. We can use images from different sources:

- **Image hash**: Previously uploaded query images by the user on the `POST /query_files` endpoint. In that case the image reference will be the **image hash** returned by the endpoint. 
- **Image id**: Previously uploaded catalog images by the user with the `POST /imgs` endpoint. In that case the image reference will be the image id. **In future realease**
- **Image URL**: **In future realease**



## Text Subfilter `t`
<Warning>This subfilter is not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>

We can modify the semantic content of the image with a semantic text modification. This is useful when we want to modify the meaning / composition / style of the query image.


## Examples
Cosidering a 123456789 as the image reference:

- `i~123456789` AI search for finding similar images. 
- `i=123456789` Identity search for finding the same image even with severe Photoshop modifications. 
- `i===123456789` Identity search for finding only exact matches. 
- `i~123456789[t~at night]` AI search with text modification (eg. changing a day light picture to be at night) **In future realease**
