AI search. Wesos Search understand the query description and it will retrive simantic-similar results.

In semantic search, unlike traditional search, the longer and more descriptive the query, the better.

Literal search where it try to find exact corresponces (literal matches) with the text of the image. The text of the image includes:
- Headline (text provided by the client)
- Caption (text provided by the client)
- Detected text in the image itself (OCR)

> Note of fulltext search:
> - capital letters are considered as lowercased. Searching for "USA" will match with "usa"
> - Only saves the root of the words (lemmas). Searching for "meditate" will match with "meditates", "meditation", etc.
