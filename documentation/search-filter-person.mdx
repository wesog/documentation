## Introduction

The person filter is one of the most complete filters in Wesog Search.
It allows users to filter celebrities by entering their name or uploading an image of their face.
Additionally, it can be refined by specifying various attributes such as age, emotion, clothing, nationality, etc.

The syntax for the person filter is as follows:

```
p=<name or face or anyone>[ <subfilters such as age, emotion, clothes, ...> ]
```

## Search by person name

<Warning>Search by person name is not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>

To search for a specific celebrity, the name must be specified.
Here are several examples of celebrity names:

- `p=Taylor Swift`
- `p=Barack Obama`
- `p=John F. Kennedy`


## Search by person face

In addition to the celebrity name, celebrities can also be searched by the face from an uploaded query image (or an existing image).

The first step is to upload an image using the `/query_files` endpoint. If an image with 3 faces is uploaded, the `/query_files` response will look something like this:

```json
{
  "img_ref": 10405030202,
  "faces": [
    [0.4, 0.2, 0.8, 0.4], // face 1
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], // face 2
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], // face 3
  ]
}
```

The response includes both the image reference and the list of face positions sorted from largest to smallest. The face position is an array of 4 numbers specifying the top-left and bottom-right points of the face rectangle.

To use the faces from uploaded images as a person filter, the syntax is as follows:


```
p=<image reference>_<face number>
p=<image reference>_<face number>[ <optional subfilters> ]
```

- `p=10405030202_1` Filter images that contains the face 1 of image 10405030202
- `p=10405030202_2` Filter images that contains the face 1 of image 10405030202
- `p=10405030202_3` Filter images that contains the face 1 of image 10405030202
- `p=10405030202_1 && p=10405030202_3` Filter images that contains both face 1 and 3 of image 10405030202
- `p=10405030202_1 && p=123456789_4` Filter images that contains both faces of different uploaded images.



## Subfilters

<Warning>Person Subfilters is not ready yet. It will be available in future realeases of Wesog Search.</Warning>


### Search by `any` person

Note that apart from searching a person by their name or face, `any` can be used as the main filter value to add custom subfilter attributes. This is very useful for performing "multi-person" searches, such as *photographs containing Spanish actresses aged between 20 and 30*:

```
p=any[g=woman && n=spain && j=actor && age≥20 && age≤30]
```

This specifies the subfilters: gender `g`, nationality `n`, job occupation `j` and age `a`



### Age
- **Exact number**: `a=18`, `a=43`, ...
- **Number range**: `a>18`, `a≥20`, `a≥20 && a≤40`, ...

> ### Look-alike age
> Also Wesog Search can look not only by the real age of the person in the photo, but also **by the age they appear to be**.
> `a~baby`, `a~child`, `a~adult`, `a~senior`


### Gender
`g=man` or `g=woman`


### Emotion
`e~angry`, `e~disgust`, `e~fear`, `e~happy`, `e~neutral`, `e~sad`, `e~surprised`

> ### Other emotions
> Note that if an emotion is missing, you can use the text subfilter. Examples:
>
> `t~calm`, `t~crying`, `t~excited`, `t~laughing`, `t~serious`, `t~smiling`, `t~thoughtful`


### Job occupation
`j=politician`, `j=singer`, `j=footballer`, ...


### Nationality
`n=brazil`, `n=canada`, `n=india`, `n=nigeria`, ...


### Shot
