## Introduction

The search endpoint `GET /imgs` is the most powerful API endpoint, allowing the creation of complex queries using a custom syntax. This page explains how to use the Wesog Search API to construct advanced search queries.


### Input: Request Parameters

The search endpoint (`HTTP GET /imgs`) has the following URL parameters:

- `q`: Query Filtering Formula
- `sort`: Sorting options (default: `id`)
- `page`: The page number (starting from 1) (default: `1`)
- `size`: The number of images per page (default: `50`)
- `fields`: The returning image fields (comma-separated) (default: `id`)
- `lang`: The language used the text filters search (default: `en`)


### Output: Returned Response

The response is a JSON object containing the found images (`images`) and additional information such as the total number of images found and the time taken. The `images` field is a list of image objects containing the specified `fields`.



### Example request:

```
HTTP GET /imgs?q=t:us elections 2024&fields=id,headline
```

### Example response:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {"id": 323, "headline": "Joe Biden drops his candidacy for president of the United States"},
    {"id": 324, "headline": "Donald Trump getting shot in the ear"}
  ],
  "total": 2,
  "time_taken": "0.02s"
